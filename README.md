## Overview

SHOKEN is a unified trading terminal that brings multiple market types into a single interface:

- Perpetual Futures
- Spot Trading (CLOB)
- Prediction Markets
- Rewards & Pools

The platform is designed to expose **real market structure** — orderbooks, prices, and execution — without custodial risk or hidden abstractions.

## What’s Live (Beta)

This beta release focuses on core functionality and user feedback.

### 1. Dashboard
The dashboard provides a high-level overview of:
- Account status
- Active positions

### 3. Spot Trading (CLOB)

SHOKEN uses a **Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)** model for spot trading.

**Why CLOB?**
- Transparent price discovery
- Real bid / ask dynamics
- No curve-based pricing

Spot trading is available in **early-stage beta** and will continue to evolve.

### 4. Prediction Markets

Prediction markets allow users to trade on real-world outcomes using YES / NO positions.

**Characteristics:**
- Probability-based pricing
- Orderbook-style liquidity
- Clear resolution criteria

Prediction markets are treated as **markets**, not gambling interfaces.

Pools allow users to participate in shared liquidity or system-level activities.

This feature is **experimental** and subject to iteration based on usage and feedback.
