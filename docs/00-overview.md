# Overview

SHOKEN is a unified, non-custodial trading platform designed to expose real market mechanics in a clean and transparent interface.

Rather than focusing on surface-level UX or short-term incentives, SHOKEN is built around core trading primitives:
- Orderbooks
- Prices
- Liquidity
- Execution

The platform brings multiple market types into a single system:
- Perpetual Futures
- Spot Trading (CLOB)
- Prediction Markets
- Rewards and Pools (beta features)

SHOKEN is currently running in **early beta on mainnet**.
