# Access & Network

## Network

SHOKEN operates directly on **mainnet** during beta. There is no separate testnet interface for end users.

## Wallet Connection

- Wallet connection is required for most features
- Transactions must be signed by the user
- SHOKEN does not store private keys

Users should always review transaction details before signing.

## Usage Recommendations

- Start with small amounts
- Expect UI and logic changes
- Do not assume beta features are final
