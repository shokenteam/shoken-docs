# Introduction

SHOKEN exists to solve a common problem in modern trading platforms: fragmentation.

Most traders are forced to switch between multiple tools, interfaces, and custody models depending on the market they want to trade. SHOKEN consolidates these experiences into a single terminal with a shared wallet context and consistent mental model.

## Design Philosophy

SHOKEN is built around the following principles:

### Market-First Design
Markets dictate the interface — not the other way around. If liquidity is thin, SHOKEN shows it. If spreads are wide, they are not hidden.

### Non-Custodial by Default
SHOKEN never holds user funds. All actions require explicit wallet approval, and assets remain under user control at all times.

### Transparency Over Abstraction
There are no simulated balances, hidden buffers, or artificial smoothing. What you see reflects the actual system state.

### Built in Public
SHOKEN is developed openly. Features ship incrementally, and unfinished components are clearly labeled.
